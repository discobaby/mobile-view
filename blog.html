  <div class="box three">The Significance of the Blackout Cover
    <p>
      The 'Blackout' album cover has always been one of my favorites. For starters, the black hair is something that we have never seen from Britney.. and I love it. It is so edgy and fits the vibe of the album completely. The pink dress that was originally white, but photoshopped has become one of her most iconic looks. It coincides with the white fedora so well, which she is keeping on her head. The mess in the background, where you can see her reflection but it is covered up by the orange squares just shows that there is so much going on, almost too much- like a BLACKOUT.
